## Overview
This project was completed by a team of five for the University of Melbourne subject COMP30022 (IT Project).
As part of this subject, we were assigned a client, who gave us a list of requirements, and we worked to fulfil them.
These requirements were subject to change, and we follow agile development practices.  

Our task was to create a Customer Relationship Management system (CRM). 
We decided to use a Django backend coupled with a React frontend. These are contained in the backend and frontend folders respectively.
A number of steps are needed to run the app, which are detailed in the READMEs.
Please contact the team for the URL and credentials of the deployed versions to experience the software running with infrastructure and data already set-up.
